# what is global warming ?
**Global warming** is the gradual increase in the Earth's average surface temperature observed primarily since the pre-industrial period (around 1850-1900). This warming is mainly caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and other pollutants into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the sun, leading to the so-called "greenhouse effect" and causing the Earth's temperature to rise[1][2][3].

The temperature increase has been roughly 1.07°C (about 1.9°F) since the mid-19th century, with a continuing upward trend at an unprecedented rate. This warming disrupts climate patterns, affects ecosystems, and contributes to rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, and other environmental impacts[2][3][4].

In summary, **global warming is the long-term heating of the Earth’s surface caused primarily by human-induced increases in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in significant changes to the planet’s climate system**[1][2][3][5].
# 1. What are the main causes of global warming
The **main causes of global warming** are primarily related to human activities that increase greenhouse gas emissions, leading to the trapping of heat in the Earth's atmosphere. The key causes include:

- **Burning of fossil fuels** (coal, oil, and gas) for energy, transportation, and industry. This releases large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide, which are major greenhouse gases[2][3][5].

- **Deforestation**, or cutting down forests, which reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut, the carbon stored in them is released as CO2, increasing greenhouse gas levels[2][4].

- **Agriculture and livestock farming**, especially ruminant animals like cows and sheep that produce methane during digestion. Fertilizers used in agriculture also emit nitrous oxide[2][3].

- **Industrial processes and manufacturing**, which emit various greenhouse gases including CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. Industrial pollution contributes significantly to global warming[1][2][3].

- **Transport and vehicles**, which mostly run on fossil fuels, emitting CO2 and other pollutants[1].

- **Overfishing** indirectly contributes by affecting marine ecosystems that play a role in regulating carbon cycles, although it is a less direct cause compared to emissions[1].

- **Fluorinated gases** used in refrigeration and air conditioning, which have a very high warming potential — up to 23,000 times that of CO2[2][3].

Overall, **the largest contributors are fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, agriculture (especially livestock), and industrial activities**, all of which increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere and drive global warming[1][2][3][5].
