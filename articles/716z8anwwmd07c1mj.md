# article 21 of the indian constitution
Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states: “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law”[3][2][1]. 

This article guarantees the fundamental right to life and personal liberty to every person, including foreigners. The protection is available only against actions of the State and its agencies; it is not applicable to private individuals. The right to life is not merely about survival but includes the right to live with dignity and make life meaningful[2][1]. 

The scope of Article 21 has been expanded by judicial interpretation to include rights such as privacy and, for children, the right to education[4][2]. Through amendments, Article 21A was inserted, making free and compulsory education a fundamental right for children aged 6 to 14[4]. All deprivations of life or liberty must adhere to a legally established procedure[3][2].
# 1. How has the Supreme Court interpreted Article 21 over time
The Supreme Court of India has **significantly expanded the interpretation of Article 21** over time, transforming it from a narrow protection against arbitrary state action to a broad guarantee of various fundamental rights essential to a dignified life.

**Early Interpretation (A.K. Gopalan case, 1950):**  
Initially, the Court took a *restrictive* view. In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, it held that "procedure established by law" meant any procedure enacted by the legislature, regardless of fairness or reasonableness. The Court rejected the concept of substantive "due process" and treated fundamental rights as isolated provisions. This meant Article 21 only prevented deprivation of life or liberty if a proper law existed, even if the law was arbitrary[1].

**Transformative Shift (Maneka Gandhi case, 1978):**  
This approach changed dramatically in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India. The Supreme Court ruled that the procedure established by law must be "fair, just and reasonable," thus introducing a substantive due process element similar to the U.S. 5th Amendment. The Court also expanded the meaning of life and personal liberty beyond mere existence, affirming the right to live with dignity and to a meaningful life. This judgment marked the Court’s move towards interpreting the Constitution as a living document[3][4].

**Broad Expansion of Rights:**  
Following Maneka Gandhi, the Supreme Court has included numerous rights under the umbrella of Article 21, such as:  
- Right to privacy (recognized as a fundamental right in 2017)  
- Right to livelihood  
- Right to clean environment  
- Right to health  
- Right to education (leading to Article 21A)  
- Protection against illegal detention and torture  

The Court’s interpretation sees Article 21 as guaranteeing not just survival, but a life with dignity and all basic human necessities. Deprivation of life or liberty must comply with fair and reasonable legal procedure, safeguarding citizens against arbitrary state action[1][4][5].

In summary, the Supreme Court has evolved Article 21 from a narrow procedural safeguard to a broad protector of human dignity and all essential aspects of life, establishing it as a cornerstone of human rights jurisprudence in India.
