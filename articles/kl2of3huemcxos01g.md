# what is global warming?
**Definition of Global Warming:**
Global warming refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, primarily due to the increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. This phenomenon is largely attributed to human activities like fossil fuel burning and deforestation[1][2][3].

**Causes:**
- **Human Activities:** Fossil fuel burning, deforestation, and industrial practices are major contributors[2][3].
- **Greenhouse Gases:** Carbon dioxide, CFCs, and other gases trap heat, leading to warming[1][3].

**Effects:**
- Rising global temperatures
- Melting of ice sheets and glaciers
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events[3][4].
# 1. What are the main causes of global warming
The main causes of global warming are:

1. **Burning Fossil Fuels:** Coal, oil, and gas are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily carbon dioxide[2][3][4].
2. **Deforestation:** Cutting down trees reduces the ability of forests to absorb carbon dioxide[3][4].
3. **Agriculture and Livestock:** Farming activities and livestock produce methane and nitrous oxide, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions[3][4].
4. **Industrial Activities:** Manufacturing and industrial processes release various pollutants and greenhouse gases[1][3].
5. **Transportation:** Vehicles emit significant amounts of carbon dioxide[1][2].
