## What is this?

Curious Articles is a web app that uses AI to generate comprehensive articles by recursively exploring topics. You provide a subject, and the app builds a tree of related questions—answering each one to create a detailed, structured article.

### How It Works

1. **Enter a topic** — e.g., "The history of artificial intelligence"
2. **Set depth & breadth** — Control how deep and wide the exploration goes
3. **AI generates content** — Perplexity AI explores the topic recursively
4. **Get your article** — A structured, in-depth article is saved to your library
